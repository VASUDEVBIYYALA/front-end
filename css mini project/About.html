            <p>Appetizers are the first course served when seated at a table. 
                An appetizer is meant to complement an entrée and is generally a small-portioned first course of a multi-course meal.
                 Appetizers are meant to whet the appetite before the following courses. Appetizers connote that a dinner will follow.

                Usually, an appetizer is a small serving of food — just a few bites — meant to be eaten before an entree,
                 and often shared by several people. You can also call an appetizer an hors d'oeuvre. 
                An appetizer is meant to stimulate your appetite, making you extra hungry for your meal.

                At restaurants or formal dinners, the entrée is the main course, or sometimes a dish before the main course.
                 Dinner features a hot entrée of chicken, veal, or lamb.
                 There is a selection of appetizers followed by an entrée. Dessert will be served after the entrée.

                Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. 
                The course consists of sweet foods, such as cake, biscuit, ice cream and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur.
                 Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts.
